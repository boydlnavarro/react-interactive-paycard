# react-interactive-paycard

Inspired from a vue project [vue-interactive-paycard](https://github.com/muhammederdem/vue-interactive-paycard), i decided to clone and code the same on React.

A fantastic credit card form with smooth and sweet micro-interactions. Includes number formatting, validation and automatic card type detection. Built with vuejs and also fully responsive
